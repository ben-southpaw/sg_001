# Small Giants Job Board

A job board application built for Small Giants using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates my approach to building a modern, responsive web application with a focus on user experience and clean code.

## Features

- üîç Advanced search functionality with highlighting
- üè∑Ô∏è Multiple filter options (region, industry, experience level)
- üì± Fully responsive design for all device sizes
- ‚ú® Smooth animations and transitions
- üìù Job application form with validation

## My Development Process

I built this application over the course of several days, focusing on creating a clean, intuitive interface for job seekers. I started with the basic structure and gradually added features, making sure to maintain good code organization throughout.

Some of the challenges I faced included:
- Implementing the search functionality with proper highlighting
- Creating a responsive layout that works well on all devices
- Handling the date formatting consistently
- Adding smooth transitions between states

I've documented my architectural decisions in the [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) file.

## Running the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, I would like to add:

- Dark mode support
- More advanced filtering options
- User accounts to save favorite jobs
- Email notifications for job applications
- Admin dashboard for managing job listings

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 13+ with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React Hooks
